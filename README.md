This was a project for my Mobile Computing class where  I  and my friends developed an interior design augmented reality android application to allow users to design their house before buying the actual furniture. The app can be downloaded from our website [FAR APP](https://www.far.helep0d.xyz/). 

The project uses the following technologies:
  - AR CORE by Google
  - Sceneform by google
